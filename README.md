## Abstract
Many security systems are used in buildings where doors are to be monitored e.g. in prison. The condition of doors that is if the door is closed or open is monitored continuously in the analog form while data is transmitted in digital form to the monitor panel for data processing and alerting. Hence, the circuit implemented is the application of mixed signal. To design this circuit, an astable multivibrator is used to generate a square wave. A MOD-16 counter has 16 states in its count sequence and used for counting operation. A 16x1 Multiplexer is used for data monitoring operation and after transmission of data, 1x16 Demultiplexer is used for data processing. This design reduces the amount of wiring. It transfers the door data to the alert system using only single wire.
